# ðŸ“š Extraction-based summarization
This project uses two ways to summarize `.txt` files:

1. **Word Frequencies.**
2. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency).**

All this code is contained in a Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ§  Description
- **Word Frequency**: ranks words by how often they appear in the document.
- **TF-IDF**: measures how important a word is in the document relative to others.

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation
**ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)** is a set of metrics used to automatically evaluate the quality of generated text by comparing it to one or more reference texts. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between the generated content and the reference. ROUGE is commonly used in summarization tasks, and its most used variants are:

- **ROUGE-1:** unigram (word-level) overlap
- **ROUGE-2:** bigram (two-word) overlap
- **ROUGE-L:** longest common subsequence (LCS)

Higher ROUGE scores indicate better similarity to human-written references.
